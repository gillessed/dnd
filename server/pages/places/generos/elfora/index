<content>
    <section> Introduction <>
        <p>Elfora is a country in the west of <a t="#places_generos">#<>. It was one of the five countries to be born out
        of the ashes of Galacia and the settlers from <a t="#places_*_kergoon">#<>.<>

    <section> History <>
        <heading level="1"> City States <>
            <p>Elfora arose out of the ashes of the Galacian empire. <a t="#places_*_greenbriar">#<>
            and <a t="#places_*_menderon">#<>, two of the large city states formed by settlers
            from Kergoon eventually banded together and declared that together, with the small towns
            and villages, formed the nation of Elfora in 349 AK. Many think that this was a move to counter the militaristic
            build-up of the central city states. The formation of Tamaret and Caligna posed a signicant threat to the city states
            along the western seaboard, so banding together was the only viable option.<>

            <p>Greenbriar and Menderon held negotiations over the span of a few months, and the actual declaration
            of nationhood was made very quickly. The need for some sort of defensive assurance was pressuring the government
            to get this done as soon as possible.<>

            <p>All the states agreed the capital should be <a t="#places_*_greenbriar">#<>. As the largest
            and most central city, it was the ideal town to establish the government. <a t="#places_*_greenbriar">#<>
            has remained Elfora's most influential and powerful city since the establishment of the nation.<>

        <heading level="1"> Uneasy Peace <>
            <p>The Elforans are a very peaceful people and have never wished to engage in war. Elfora spent many years negotiating
            its way out of wars with <a t="#places_*_tamaret">#<> and <a t="#places_*_caligna">#<>.<>

            <p>However, while Elfora is generally peaceful in its actions, it stands ready to defend itself. The government
            spent significant amounts of time trying to shore up defenses and train the military to be ready in case of
            an emergency.<>

            <p>Over the years, there were a few skirmishes with <a t="#places_*_tamaret">#<> and <a t="#places_*_caligna">#<>,
            but they were usually too busy fighting amongst themselves to care about Elfora. They also knew that if they attacked
            Elfora alone, the other would take advantage of this weakness, and finish off the other country.<>

        <heading level="1"> Alliance with Dirchen <>
            <p>When the nation of <a t="#places_*_dirchen">#<> was founded, the Cirrans were wary of the humans
            to the south, but managed to find common ground with the Elforans. The Cirrans felt similarily to the Elforans in
            terms of being non-confrontational, and the Elforans used this to garner the trust of the Cirrans. It took some time and
            negotiation, but the two nations brokered a peace treaty that can even be described as a loose alliance.
            The Cirrans became quite welcoming to visitors, and the two countries started trading with each other a lot.<>

            <p>There have even been, on limited occasions, military cooperation, especially when it comes to holding back the
            creatures in the <a t="#generos_theBlight">#<>. Every nation in Generos fears <a t="#generos_theBlight">#<>
            and has been one of the uniting factors the few times all the nations have worked together, and Elfora and Dirchen
            are no exception.<>

        <heading level="1"> The First Blight War <>
            <p> The first time all the nations in <a t="#places_generos">#<> worked together was the first blight wars. Elfora
            was no exception. They contributed a fair number of troops, and helped out a lot in pushing back the western
            lines of battle.<>
    <section> Geography <>
        <p>Elfora borders <a t="#places_*_dirchen">#<> to the north, and <a t="#places_*_caligna">#<> to the east.<>

        <heading level="1"> Climate <>
            <p>Elfora is temperate and the temperatures are kept a little stable by Elfora's proximity to the
            <a t="places_sysifalOcean">#<>. There is a moderate amount of rainfall in the fall and spring, and they
            see a little snow in the winter.<>

            <p>The temperatures never fall much below 0 and rarely go above 25 except in the more inland areas. Overall, the
            climate is fairly well suited to life and poeple lead comfortable existences.<>

        <heading level="1"> Flora <>
            <p> Elfora, like all the other plains nations, are mostly covered in grass. It is fairly dry grass, and can
            be between a few centimetres all the way to three metres tall. It is very easy to get extremely lost in the
            taller patches of grass. <>

            <p>Occasional forests dot the plains, and are a source of economic benefit. Most of the trees are deciduous,
            and grow quite tall, but fairly far apart.<>

            <p>The soil of Elfora is reasonably arable, and can support a wide variety of crops, but it is not verdant, and
            the Elforans expend a lot of effort irrigating the lands they grow on.<>
        <heading level="1"> Fauna <>
            <p>Common animals known to all Elforans:<>
            <ul>
                <li>Greenbear<>
                <li>Stretcher Hares<>
            <>
    <section> Economy <>
        <heading level="1">Food<>
            <p> The Elforans are very competent seafarers and get a lot of their food from the sea. Elforanc cuisine commonly
            features seafood. The most famous dishes in the country are all some sort of seafood dish. However, while the
            Elforans are great fishermen, they are not generally skilled hunters. They prefer to leave the animals of the
            land alone. <>

            <p> There is some agricultural areas in the country where farming is a common practise, but this is only a secondary
            source of food. This is more common in landlocked towns such as <a t="#places_*_lairom">#<>,
            <a t="#places_*_gaveena">#<> and <a t="#places_*_varen">#<>. Most of the farming is plants and vegetables, though
            there are a few animal farms here and there. <>

        <heading level="1">Mana<>
            <p>Elforans have traditionally relied very heavily on forest mana and water mana.<>
            <p>There are many forest camps setup to harvest life particles that exist within the many small forests.<>
