<title desc="Country in West Generos"> Elfora <>
<section> Introduction <>
    <p>Elfora is a country in the west of <a t="places_generos">Generos<>. It was one of the three countries to be born out
    of the ashes of Galacia and the settlers from <a t="places_generos_kergoon">Kergoon<>.<>
<section> History <>
    <p>Elfora arose out of the ashes of the Galacian empire. Greenbriar, Kenkenot and Menderon, three of the large city
    states formed by settlers from Kergoon eventually banded together and declared that together, with the small towns
    and villages, formed the nation of Elfora in 349 AK. Many think that this was a move to counter the militaristic
    build-up of the central city states. The formation of Tamaret and Caligna posed somewhat of a threat to the nation
    so they banded together as well.<>
    <p>Everyone mutually agreed the capital should be <a t="places_generos_elfora_greenbriar">Greenbriar<>. As the largest
    and most central city, it was the ideal town to establish the government<>
    <p>Elfora has been a peaceful nation since its inception, and have been fairly non-aggressive, mostly concerned
    about protecting their own borders. Elfora chose not to interfere in the common skirmishes between the other
    nations, and as a result, become quite prosperous.<>
    <p>When the nation of <a t="places_generos_dirchen">Dirchen<> was founded, the Cirrans were wary of the humans
    to the south, but managed to find common ground with the Elforans. It took some time and negotiation, but the
    two nations brokered a peace treaty that can even be described as a loose alliance. They are quite welcoming to
    visitors, and trade between each other a lot. There have even been, on limited occasions, military cooperation.<>
<section> Geography <>
    <p>Elfora borders <a t="places_generos_dirchen">Dirchen<> to the north, and
    <a t="places_generos_caligna">Caligna<> to the east.<>
    <heading level="1"> Climate <>
        <p>Elfora is temperate and the temperatures are kept a little stable by Elfora's proximity to the
        <a t="places_sysifal">Sysifal Ocean<>. There is a moderate amount of rainfall in the fall and spring, and they
        see a little snow in the winter.<>
        <p>The temperatures never fall much below 0 and rarely go above 25 except in the more inland areas.<>
    <heading level="1"> Flora <>
        <p>Elfora, like all the other nations on the plains, are mostly covered in grass. It is fairly dry grass, and can
        be between a few centimetres all the way to two metres tall.<>
        <p>Occasional forests dot the plains, and are a source of economic benefit. Most of the trees are deciduduous,
        and grow quite tall, but fairly far apart.<>
        <p>The soil of Elfora is reasonably arable, and can support a wide variety of crops.<>
