    <section> History <>
        <heading level="1"> Settlers <>
            <p>When settlers from Kergoon came out across the plains of Generos, they moved across slowly, all the way to the
            other shores. Along the way, there were pockets of small hamlets and refuges where people were eking out a meager
            existence.<>
            <p>The largest of such villages in the west, was a small town named Greenbriar. The people in the town were descendants
            of Galacians, but had lost much of their knowledge of mana and magic. The town had no more than a thousand people,
            but was growing little by little.<>
            <p>The settlers were drawn to Greenbriar as a place where they could settle down without much trouble since there
            were already people around. It also attracted some interest as it was build on top of reasonably well preserved
            Galacian ruins. The bay also provided access to the ocean and was easily protectable, and full of wildlife to make
            a living fishing.<>
        <heading level="1"> City State <>
            <p>Greenbriar quickly became the most influential town in the area, and it became one of the great city states
            of the plains of <a t="#places_generos">#<>.<>
