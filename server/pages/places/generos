<title> Generos <>
<section> Introduction <>
    <p>Generos is an area of grassy plains and hills which currently encompasses several competing city states. It is
    in the southern area of <a t="places_cariadon">Cariadon<>, bordering the desert of <a t="places_khandayr">Khandayr<>
    .<>
<section> History <>
    <heading level="1"> Fall of Galacia <>
        <p>The oldest known kingdom in the plains of Generos was the kingdom of Galacia, one of the participants in the
        Apocalypse of Karthuun. It was a truly spectacular human kingdom that was brought to ruins after the war with
        the hordes of Kjeldorn.<>
        <p>In the hundreds of years following the war, the kingdom had struggles keeping up its thriving economy and
        rich culture due to such a large loss of population and resources. The victory had cost the Galacians the most
        of any of the allied forces, and the price was great.<>
        <p>Many cities lay in ruin, and those that were still standing were barely standing and functioning. A shortage
        in mana production led to a lot of the cities' mana infrastrucures to shut down and become inoperable.<>
        <p>In an effort to maintain the capital of <a t="Rhea">Rhea<>, the capital eventually isolated itself from the
        rest of the country and left the rest of the country to decay on its own. Most people outside of Galacia started
        migrating up to more fertile lands and left Generos, leaving it to be uninhabited except for Rhea for another
        few hundred years.<>
    <heading level="1"> Settlers from Kergoon <>
        <p>As time went on, there was a migration of a mix of people from the jungles of <a t="places_kergoon">Kergoon<>
        headed towards Generos. They formed many small villages all over Generos. As the towns grew and the settlers
        started calling Generos their home, three cities emerged as the most influential and powerful. The land was
        essentially divided into three states.<>

    <heading level="1"> City States <>
        <p>For the last 200 years, the various small city states that have emerged out of the ashes of Galacia have been
        fighting amongst one another a little, but are for the most part on decent terms.<>
<section> Geography <>
    <p>Generos is mostly covered in grasslands with scarce coniferous forest.<>
