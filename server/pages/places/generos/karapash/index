    <section> Introduction <>
        <p>The desert kingdom of Karapash is ancient and its origins somewhat mysterious. Legends say that the man who founded
        Karapash, <a t="#karapash_sareeshBataarem">#<> was descended from the God of Water himself. It remains someone isolated due to
        the desert conditions around it, and almost all of the populations lies on the delta of the <a t="#karapash_komanharRiver">#<>.<>
    <section> History <>
        <heading level="1">Founding<>
            <p> The scriptures of Karapash say that "the first man to lay his eyes on the bounty of the delta" was a man
            named <a t="#karapash_sareeshBataarem">#<>. Legend has it that Sareesh arrived at the Delta with his followers,
            and the river imbued him with incredible strength, as if he was possessed with the powers of a water god.<>

            <p> Sareesh was said to have blessed the land around with bountiful life amidst the scorching desert. The
            <a t="#karapash_komanharRiver">Komanhar Delta<> became a verdant paradise, and Sareesh and his followers settled
            there and the nation of Karapash was born in 182AK, with Sareesh becoming the first <a t="#samkhar">#<>.<>

            <p> Kaparash claimed all the land from the <a t="places_sysifalOcean">#<> to the <a t="#generos_senetehpMountains">#<>
            to the southern steppe and the <a t="generos_omanungiSea">#<>. However, almost everyone lives in the
            <a t="#karapash_komanharRiver">Komanhar Delta<> because it is much more hospitable than anywhere else in the
            kingdom. <>
        <heading level="1"> The Khandayr Expedition <>
            <p> The class structure of Karapash was intially very rigid, with people being one of three things: a farmer,
            a priest, or a soldier. The farmers grew food and sustained the kingdom. The soldiers were those who defended the
            kingdom from attack. The priests are those devoted the arts of water magic. <>

            <p> As the population grew and trade began with the city states to the north, the merchant class grew, and desired
            more than this strict life would allow. A group of such merchants organized an expedition across the desert to the
            east, later to be called the <a t="khandayrExpedition">#<>. The expedition was largely a success and the explorers
            established a number of mines in the <a t="#generos_senetehpMountains">#<>, as well as a route to travel between
            the <a t="#karapash_komanharRiver">Komanhar Delta<> and the <a t="#generos_senetehpMountains">#<>.<>
