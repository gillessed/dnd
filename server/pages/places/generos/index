    <section> Introduction <>
        <p>Generos is one of the three large continents. While not completed isolated by land, but is still considered
        separate from the northern continent of <a t="#places_karametra">#<>.<>
    <section> History <>
        <p>4000BK: Tilith and Garish appear in Generos.<>
        <p>2500BK: Humans arrive from Mervala.<>
        <p>1000BK: Galacian empire forms near where central Caligna is. The Tilish and Garish are pushed more and more south.
        Some join the empire, but most prefer to keep to their own, but can't fight Galacia.<>
        <p>300BK - 200BK: First war with the Kjeldorn.<>
        <p>100BK: Second war with the Kjeldorn.<>
        <p>20BK: Kjeldorn takes the entire plains which became the blight.<>
        <p>3BK: The Kjeldorn take everything north of what is Karapash, except for Rhea.<>
        <p>0AK: The Apocalypse of Karthuun. The Kjeldorn homeland is obliterated, and the weapon sinks the land. Galacians
        either retreat to Rhea or join the expedition across to Evanestu. Cirrans migrate south from their homeland to Dirchen.<>
        <p>3AK: Rhea takes off and flies over towards Kanesava.<>
        <p>20AK: Khandayr becomes an uninhabitable desert. The Glimmerpond fills with water.<>
        <p>50AK: The humans of Kergoon, largely unaffected by the war, spread out onto the plains of Generos.<>
        <p>100AK: The Komanhar delta become lush and verdant.<>
        <p>183AK: Karapash is established in the delta and thrives under the rich mana of the Komanhar river.<>
        <p>250AK-350AK: Rise to power of the Generosian city states.<>
        <p>371AK: The First Blight War. The Blight Pact is signed.<>
        <p>400AK: Loose alliances start appearing between certain city states. Menderon and Greenbriar. Braven and Kenkennot.
        Fanith and Avalton. Senpuka and Sindain. Son Verk, Ronfarr and Tannaval.<>
        <p>414AK: Son Verk, Ronfarr and Tannaval establish the nation of Verkun.<>
        <p>440AK: Avalton and Fanith establish the nation of Caligna.<>
        <p>442AK: Braven and Kenkennot establish the nation of Tamaret.<>
        <p>443AK: Senpuka and Sindain establish the nation of Sigilbur.<>
        <p>462AK: Greenbriar and Menderon establish the nation of Elfora.<>
        <p>640AK: The Second Blight War.<>
        <p>721AL: Sigilbur attacks Verkun. This starts one of the bloodiest wars in Generos between human nations.<>
        <p>735AK: The Garish come down from the Senetehp mountains and conquer the southern shores of Generos. Karapash
        technically claimed that area, but can't do much about it. They are well set to defend the delta and their mines,
        but not their southern claims. They conquer and enslave a lot of the Tilith living among the Cliffs of Haneed.<>
        <p>740AK: Tilith establish Neeksam in Elfora as a refugee haven for the Tilith escaping the Garish.<>
        <p>745AK: After a long war, Verkun annilihates Sigilbur.<>
        <p>780AK: Verkun sets it's crosshairs on Caligna, seeing the same militaristic buildup it saw in Sigilbur. Verkunians
        believe they are acting in self-defence.<>
        <p>792AK: The Third Blight War. Verkun is nearly overrun, and loses significant military power.<>
        <p>799AK: Seeing Verkun weakened, Caligna sees this as an opportunity to conquer Tamaret, and the Garish take the
        opportunity to attack Verkun.<>
        <p>820AK: Caligna gains the upper hand, and Tamaret surrenders. Kenkennot however, chooses to defect to Elfora, knowing
        the Elforans would treat the better. The remains of Tamaret is divided between Caligna and Elfora.<>
        <p>830AK: Verkun pushes the Garish back, and they largely disappear from frontlines. Verkun takes its time to lick
        its wounds and reshore up its defences. This causes Caligna pause and it ceases to think about Elfora for now.<>
        <p>859AK: With renewed vigor, the Garish attack Verkun once again. They start a long bloody war.<>
        <heading level="1"> Present Day (861AK) <>
        <p>With Verkun once again at war with Verkun, the Calignans are finally able to set their sights
        on Elfora. They generally have the upper hand in military strength, and Elforans are pretty sure they will lose the
        war if Caligna attacks, unless Dirchen intervenes. However, this is not guaranteed as the Cirrans are having domestic
        power struggle problems and may not be able to assist the Elforans.<>
