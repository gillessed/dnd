<title desc="Jungle in East Generos"> Kergoon <>
<section> Introduction <>
    <p>Kergoon is a thick jungle on the southeast shores of <a t="places_generos">#<>. The origins of many of
    the countries in Generos come from here, but these days, there are not but a few tribal groups of humans living
    there among the beasts of the jungle.<>
<section> History <>
    <heading level="1"> Pre-Karthuun <>
        <p> In they days of the Galacian empire, Kergoon was inhabited by many tribes of humans who lived somewhat primitive
        but happy lives. They were in harmony with nature, and some were even known to be able to innately use the mana
        in the jungle. <>

        <p> The people living in the jungle had a fair amount of contact with Galacia, mostly through trade. However, very
        few records of this remain, and most of what is known has been passed down through generations of storytelling. <>

    <heading level="1"> Post-Karthuun <>
        <p> The <a t="apocalypseOfKarthuun">#<> had a strong impact on the jungle. In the years that followed the event,
        it is said that many beasts awoke from a deep slumber and began to terrorize the jungle. The easy going tribesmen
        were suddenly being attacked and battered by all sort of unspeakably creatures. <>

        <p> This change prompted most of the jungle dwellers to leave the jungle and venture out into the country,
        eventually founding the city states of Generos. There are small number of people who stayed behind in the jungle,
        but moved up into the trees. While the beasts were enormous and powerful, they were neither agile nor acrobatic.
        They were stuck on the ground. <>

        <p> The villages in the jungle are now integrated into the trees, with tree houses and rope bridges connecting
        everything. They live in relative safety and shelter closer to the top of the jungle but no one dares venture
        down to the surface anymore. <>

<section> Geography <>

    <p> The jungle of Kergoon is extremely verdant and the tree grow extremely tall. The jungle itself is not very dense,
    and so even at the ground level, it is not hard to get around, the tree canopies grow thick and wide, and cover up much
    of the view of the sky. While it is not pitch black at the ground level, it is certainly dark. <>

    <p> Most of the terrain is relatively hilly, but not mountainous. There are many small ravines and creeks running
    through the jungle which create a lot of ridges and small cliffs. Moving along the ground is not only dangerous,
    but is also very slow and arduous. <>
