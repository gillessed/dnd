<title>Samkhar<>
<content>
    <section> Meaning <>
        <p> The Samkhar is the title given to the current and previous rulers of <a t="#places_karapash">#<>. In their native language,
        it roughly means "God of Water". It is a tribute to how much the people believe in the use of water mana and the bounty
        the Samkhar gives the land.<>

        <p> The Samkhar is meant to be the most powerful and skilled water mage in the land. Lineage matters less in Karapash than
        ability to manipulate water mana.<>

        <p> Every ten years, or when the current Samkhar passes away, a tournament is held to decide the next Samkhar. Even
        foreigners are allowed to participate, although they have never won. The winner of this tournament goes on to become
        the next Samkhar.<>
