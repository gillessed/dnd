<section> Meaning <>
<p> While the specifics of what happened were unknown, during the Galacian's war with the Kjeldorn, as the
Kjdeldorns were approaching victory over the Galacians, something terribly happened, wiping out nearly all of
the Kjeldorn. It is not known how or what, but stories tell of a huge earthquake and bright flashes. Many thought
the world was going to end. <>
