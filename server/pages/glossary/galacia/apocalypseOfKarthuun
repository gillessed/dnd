    <section> Meaning <>
        <p> While the specifics of what happened were unknown, during the Galacian's war with the Kjeldorn, as the
        Kjdeldorns were approaching victory over the Galacians, something terribly happened, wiping out nearly all of
        the Kjeldorn. It is not known how or what, but stories tell of a huge earthquake and bright flashes. Many thought
        the world was going to end. <>
