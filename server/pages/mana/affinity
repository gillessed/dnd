<title>Mana Affinities<>

<content>
    <section> Description <>
        <p>A lot of mana types share a similarity to each other. For example, fire and lava have ssome similarities,
        so their mana does as well.<>

        <p>To cast a spell of mana type A, you can use mana of type B to cast it if A and
        B have an affinity. Doing so results in a less strong spell, but still create an effect. <>

        <p>All the abilities have an "affinity" section. This is what occurs when you perform affinity casting.<>
