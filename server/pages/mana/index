<title desc="Mana of the World">Mana<>
<section> Introduction <>
    <p>Mana is core to the world of Karyus. Mana particles exist in all matter, be it rock, earth, air, animals,
    trees, etc... Mana drawn from a certain kind of matter can be used to manipulate matter to be like what it came
    from. Fire mana can be used to create fire or heat.<>
    <p>The only thing which is known not to have mana is the thing used to extract mana are the
    <a t="mana_leviathanStone">Leviathan Stones<>, mysterious stones that that are the only thing known not to have matter
    themselves.<>
    <p>Mana drives most science and religion in the world, and powers most countries' economies. Everything
    revolves around mana.<>
<section> Harvesting <>
    <p> The big discovery about mana is that it be harvested and stored to be used later. This can only be done
    by the <a t="races_humans">Humans<> and <a t="races_tilith">Tilith<>. However, the two races do not do this equally.<>
    <heading level="1"> Humans - Mana Dust<>
        <p>When a human activates a <a t="mana_leviathanStone">Leviathan Stone<> by touching it, it causes a beam of
        bright intense light to shoot out. Whatever this light touches is disintegrated, and what is left behind is a dust]
        that contains the essence of whatever was dissolved. While this can be used on living beings, it does not dissolve
        large enough amounts of matter to be used as a tool or weapon of war. Not only that, the stones are rare enough
        that there are just not enough to be effective in that way.<>
        <p> While mana dust can only be harvested by humans, it can be used by any race, and many races buy a lot of dust
        because of its versatility. While most races have a natural affinity to a certain kind of mana, the dust can
        come from any source.<>
        <p> Mana dust is usually activated by applying it to some surface, and it generally produces something related to
        the mana's affinity. For example, water dust can be used to produce water jets or water bubbles.<>
        <p> The type of object depends on the method of extraction and the actual ratios of the dust. Usually, dust isn't
        one single kind of mana, but a combination that is often unique to an area or an organization.<>
