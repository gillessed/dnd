<title>Mana<>
<content>
    <section> Introduction <>
        <p>Mana is core to the world of Karyus. Mana particles exist in all matter, be it rock, earth, air, animals,
        trees, etc... Mana drawn from a certain kind of matter can be used to manipulate matter to be like what it came
        from. Fire mana can be used to create fire or heat.<>

        <p>The only thing which is known not to have mana is the thing used to extract mana are the
        <a t="#leviathanStone">Leviathan Stones<>, mysterious stones that that are the only thing known not to have matter
        themselves.<>

        <p>Mana drives most science and religion in the world, and powers most countries' economies. Everything
        revolves around mana.<>
    <section> Mana Use <>
        <p>Mana is all about equivalence. When mana is drawn out of an object, it consumes the object, and will produce
        an equivalent effect or creation when used. Consuming a small fire for mana can produce a similar small fire
        when the mana is used.<>

        <p>How exactly mana is consumed differs between races. All races have an innate ability to draw out mana from objects
        and channel it through their bodies. However, the power of the ability differs greatly.<>

        <p><a t="races_humans">#<> have by far the weakest innate connection to the mana in objects. Most humans have no
        ability whatsoever to manipulate mana, and even those that can are weak at it.<>

        <p>Conversely, <a t="races_cirrans">#<> are considered to be the strongest race with magic. They can channel
        unbelievable amounts of magic through their bodies, but it requires time to prepare this sort of act, and it takes
        considerably fortitude to hold this up. <>

    <section> Mana Dust <>
        <p> While humans don't have strong innate connections to mana, they are the most talented at using
        <a t="#leviathanStone">Leviathan Stones<>. Humans possess the ability to actually convert any matter into a
        powdery substance known as mana dust, which can be used to produce similar effects to those of other races
        mana abilities'.<>
