<title desc="Tool to Extract Mana">Leviathan Stone<>
<section>Description<>
    <p>Leviathan stones are the material used to extract mana from all other mana. They are rare and super valuable, and
    are generally found occuring naturally in nature.<>
    <p>The stones range in size from about a small pebble to head-sized boulder. The larger the rock, the more mana it
    can extract at once. They are usually very geometric in shape, but very irregular. There are edges that form smooth
    faces zig-zaggin all over the surface of the stones. The color of the stone is prismatic and rainbow patterns
    ebb and flow around creating a beautiful dance of light.<>
