<title>Leviathan Stone<>
<content>
    <section> Description <>

        <p>Leviathan stones are the material used to extract <a t="#manaDust">#<> from all other matter. They are very rare, and
        are generally found scattered across the world fairly randomly. They are not known to be concentrated anywhere, but
        instead just appear, sometimes underground, sometimes on or in a tree, sometimes even floating in the air. This
        makes the stones very hard to find, but very valuable. It is a viable business trade to scour the world for stones
        to sell them to mana producers.<>

        <p>The stones range in size from about a small pebble to head-sized boulder. The larger the rock, the more mana it
        can extract at once. They are usually very geometric in shape, but very irregular. There are edges that form smooth
        faces zig-zaggin all over the surface of the stones. The color of the stone is prismatic and rainbow patterns
        ebb and flow across its surface creating a beautiful dance of light.<>
