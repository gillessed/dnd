    <section> Introduction <>
        <p>Mana dust is something that only humans can create with the user of <a t="#leviathanStone">Leviathan Stones<>.<>
    <section> Process <>
        <p> When a human touches a mana stone, the mana stone shines out a bright line in the opposite direction,
        and whatever this light shines down upon starts to crumple to dust. This leftover dust is mana dust, that cen
        be used to create magical effects. <>

        <p> The process of converting matter to mana dust takes a fair amount of time. However, the larger the
        <a t="#leviathanStone">#<>, the faster the process. It also differs depending on the type of matter. Certain
        kinds dissolve faster than others.<>
