<title>Metal Mana<>

<content>
    <section> Introduction <>
        <p>Metal mana is a type of mana which comes from all the different metallic substances, either
        natural or alloyed. It is cold and smooth, but also somewhat giving and can bend a lot.<>
        <p>Due to the dense nature of metal, metal manipulators very rarely produce metal since it takes
        so much mana. It is much more common to see metal casters manipulate and bend metal to their will.<>
        <p>Metal mana has no affinities with other mana.<>

        destroy.<>
