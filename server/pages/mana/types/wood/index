<title>Wood Mana<>

<content>
    <section> Introduction <>
        <p>Wood mana is a type of mana which is harvested from all the trees of the forest and in buildings.
        People who master fire mana can create and manipulate vast structure of wood. Wood is strong and tough,
        but still easier to manipulate than <a t="#mana_*_stone">stone<> or <a t="#mana_*_metal">metal<>, thus
        can give rise to more complicated shapes and structures more easily.<>
        <p>Wood mana has an affinity with <a t="#mana_*_leaf">#<> and <a t="#mana_*_vine">#<>.<>
