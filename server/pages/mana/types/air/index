<content>
    <section> Introduction <>
        <p>Air mana is a type of mana which comes from the very air and wind itself. Fast and fickle, air mana
        can be used to create huge gusts of wind fast enough to cut through armor and flesh.<>
        <p>Air mana is unique in air mana is pretty much always around. There are cases when briefly, there might be
        no air around, and in those cases, air casters are very useless, only able to produce little gusts with
        the mana they have.<>
        <p>Air mana has no affinity with other mana.<>
