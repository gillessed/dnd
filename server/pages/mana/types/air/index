    <section> Introduction <>
        <p>Air mana is a type of mana which comes from water vapour and boiled water. It is scalding hot and
        can singe and burn enemies, and it can also cause light distortions and the like, creating illusions that
        can confuse and misdirect enemies. It can also become thicker and obscure large areas and make things
        hard to see.<>
        <p>Water mana has an affinity with <a t="#mana_*_water">#<>.<>

        <p>Ice <a t="#mana_*_manipulators">manipulators<> can strike opponents with heavy chunks of ice, or try and
        trap them and freeze them.<>
        <p>In the presence of ice, they can use that ice in their attacks as well.<>

        <heading level="1">Steam Armorers<>

        <p>In the presence of steam, they can create even larger elementals.<>
