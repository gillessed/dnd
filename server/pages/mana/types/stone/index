<title>Stone Mana<>

<content>
    <section> Introduction <>
        <p>Stone mana is a type of mana which is harvested from the rocks and stones in the ground. People
        who master stone mana can throw large boulders, animate stone golems, cover themselves in rock armor,
        and sometimes even break the ground one stands on.<>
        <p>Stone mana has an affinity with <a t="#mana_*_sand">#<> and <a t="#mana_*_lava">#<>.<>

    <section> Archetypes <>
        <heading level="1">Boulder Caster<>
        <p>Boulder casters specialize in manipulating large hunks of rock to throw and hurl at their enemies.
        Different kinds of rock have different strengths and weaknesses.<>
        <p>Creating boulders takes a significant amount of mana, but in the presence of rocks or stones, boulder
        casters can use those instead and have an even greater effect.<>

        <heading level="1">Stone Armorer<>
        <p>Stone armorers cover themselves in a heavy stone armor giving themselves great boosts to their strength
        and armor.<>

        <heading level="1">Stone Animator<>
        <p>The stone <a t="#mana_*_animators">animators<> can create stone golems to do his bidding. Stone golems have
        great strength, but are very slow, and hard to manipulate.<>
        <p>In the presence of stone, the stone animator can use that stone to create his golems using far
        less mana.<>

        <heading level="1">Ground Caster<>
        <p>The ground caster is adept at manipulating stone in the ground to cause movement, shaking, and can even
        make himself move at tremendous speeds.<>
        <p>The ground caster requires a certain kind of ground to use his abilities, and so it is more often used as
        a secondary set of skills.<>
