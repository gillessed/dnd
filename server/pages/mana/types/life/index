<content>
    <section> Introduction <>
        <p>Life mana is a type of mana which comes from the life of all beings in Karyus. It is the force that
        creates the intricate patterns of existence that cause all living things to act the way they do. Life mana
        can be used to heal and boost the strength and abilities of those around.<>
        <p>Furthermore, life casters are missing on of the types of caster: <a t="#mana_*_animators">#<>. Life mana
        doesn't really have a physical manifestation like the other types of mana, so they can't really bring to life
        an elemental that uses their mana.<>
        <p>Life mana has an affinity with <a t="#mana_*_beast">#<>.<>

        <p>Life <a t="#mana_*_manipulators">manipulators<> can use the life force in their mana to heal others wounds
        and give them great boons of strength and power.<>

        <heading level="1">Life Armorers<>
        <p>Life <a t="#mana_*_armorers">armorers<> armorers are unusual among armorers because they don't cover
        themselves in anything. Rather, they use life mana to give themselves incredible healing powers which cause
        them to recover from wounds very very quickly. While they can be easy to hit and attack, life armorers
        are very hard to take down because they recover so fast.<>

        <heading level="1">Life Item Wielders<>
        <p>Life <a t="#mana_*_itemWielders">item wielders<> wield items that use life mana to some effect.
        They are usually healing or buff items that can be used to give great power to anyone.<>
