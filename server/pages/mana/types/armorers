<content>
    <section> Description <>
        <p>Armorers are a kind of caster that specialize binding their elements to their own body to
        improve and enhance their physical attacks and defense. <>

        <p>The sigils armorers create are complex enough to make the armor move along with the caster,
        making the armor a lot less burdensome than it would be just picking up the elemental source and attaching
        it to ones body.<>
