<title>Leaf Mana<>

<content>
    <section> Introduction <>
        <p>Leaf mana is a type of mana which is harvested from leaves and needles that grow off of plants
        and trees. People who master leaf mana can create and manipulate large flurries of leaves and needles.
        Due to their fibrous molecular structure, leafs and needles can be made even sharper and pointer than metal
        wood or stone, however, it has a lot less impact than any of them.<>
        <p>Wood mana has an affinity with <a t="#mana_*_wood">#<> and <a t="#mana_*_vine">#<>.<>

        <p>Leaf <a t="#mana_*_animators">animators<> can create leaf elementals to do their bidding. Leaf elementals
        are light, and don't pack much of a punch, but are fast and can sometimes make very deadly slashing attacks.<>
        <p>In the presence of leaves, leaf animators can create much larger and more effective elementals.<>
